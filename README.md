## The Moon Programming Language
**moon** is a simple dynamically-typed stack-oriented programming language. Something I created for fun and to learn how stack-oriented programming language works.

## Example
```
"Hello, how are you?" // push string to stack
cout // pop string from stack, write it to console output
```

## F.A.Q (Frequently Asked Questions (not really))
#### Why the compiler is written in C++?
> The **moon** compiler is written in C++ because templates, no need to typedef all structs and a few other stuff. It makes things faster to write and I don't really like writing hash maps in C macros.

#### Why the name 'Moon'?
> Well, I was searching for random words, found 'Orbit' but didn't really like it much, so I thought of 'Moon' and liked it. There's probably already a programming language called 'Moon', but who cares?

#### What are your plans for the language?
> My plan is to have many different backends (like C, JavaScript) and make them very fast at runtime, so it doesn't even look like the program was written in a stack-oriented programming language.
