## The Moon Programming Language
**Moon** is a simple dynamically-typed stack-oriented programming language. It's different from the other stack-oriented programming language, it outputs an optimized executable instead of interpreting the input code.

## Example
```
"hello!" // this will push the string to stack
. // this will pop the string from stack and write it to stdout
```
