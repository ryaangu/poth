## The Poth Programming Language
**Poth** is a simple gradually-typed stack-oriented programming language. It can be compiled to many different backends (C, x64, etc) and can also be interpreted through our VM.

<br/>

## Example
```
main(-> Number)
{
    "Hello!" .
    0
}
```

## F.A.Q (Frequently Asked Questions (not really))
#### Why is this compiler written in D?
> This compiler is written in D because it's a "better" C with templates, modules and stuff that makes it easier to use and then self host later.

#### Why the name 'Poth'?
> It's the two first letters and two final letters of 'Poliwrath', my favorite Pok√©mon since I was a little kid and I don't know why lol.
